Surface is represents a surface that can be drawn on. A surface has a canvas where the actual drawing happens.

When drawing imperatively or by using the Skia components a surface has already been created for you. This surface
is not available since it is not a Javascript component but a GPU backed surface.

If you want to draw offscreen you can create your own surface and draw on it. Remember that this surface will be
backed by memory and will not be GPU accelerated.

### Example

```tsx twoslash
import { Skia } from "@shopify/react-native-skia";

const generateImage = () => {
  const surface = Skia.Surface.Make(200, 100);
  const canvas = surface.getCanvas();
  const paint = Skia.Paint();
  paint.setColor(Skia.Color("red"));
  canvas.drawPaint(paint);
  const image = surface.makeImageSnapshot();
  return image.toByteData();
};
```
